The heuristic I used to implement my version of minimax with depth limited alpha beta pruning consists of 5 main rules.

1) The number of 3's in a row for a given max player which have a +100 utility value and if the other play has 3's in a row we penalize by -50.

2) The number of 2's in a row for a given max player which have a +80 utility value for the extreme edged 2 in a row. If the 2's are near to the 
center of the board (near to 4th column) then we give them a utility score of +100 and +130. If these are true for the opponent then we penalize the states with the same utility values.

3) If the max player has his number placed in the 4th column then he has a high utility value(200). If the opponent has his number in the 4th column then we penalize it by -50.

4) If the 4th column is filled by max player and either of the adjacent columns are free then we give a positive utility value of +150.

5) If in any state we reach if the max Player has less score than the min player then we penalize it by -300 points. If in the other case Max player has greater score than min 
player then we add a utility score of +300 to that game state.
